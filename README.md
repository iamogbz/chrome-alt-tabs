> speeds up tab management with simple shortcuts

How most people move tabs between window

1. Select and drag out the tabs to a new window
2. Verify the desired destination window is visible below
3. Select and drags tabs to the destination window

That's frustrating and cumbersome especially when you prefer running your browser maximised.

`CATS` provides key bindings for moving multiple tabs between already open chrome windows.
